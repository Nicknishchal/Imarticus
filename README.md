# Overview
This project performs data analysis on the Big Mart sales data using Python and applies various machine learning algorithms to predict the sales of products in different stores. The analysis helps uncover insights about product performance, customer preferences, and factors influencing sales, enabling better business strategies.

### Project Overview
In this project, we analyze Big Mart sales data using Python, applying different machine learning algorithms to predict product sales. We explore the following:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Applying various machine learning algorithms to predict sales (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model evaluation and optimization
